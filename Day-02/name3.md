- '+' is used for addition and concadination
- javascript itself doing implicit coersion
-

# Javascript Notes

## Opertor

- Three Types
  1. Binary operator - x
  2. unary operator - x>y
  3. ternary operator -

> example website Josh

## Assinment operator

- x = x*5 == x*=5 (two assignment is same)
- Y = Y -5 == Y-=5

## Typecasting or Coersion

> parseInt use for string to convert interger
> parseFloat use for float value to convert interger

> Null and Undefined as called as Bottom values.
> Undefined is also a value.

### what is the differnce between undefined and notdefined ?

Undefined is a value. Notdefined is an Error.

### what is declaration

- creating a variable is declartion.

### Note

var g1 = 5;
var g2 = "5";

console.log(g1 == g2);
console.log(g1 === g2);

> - in == just read the values
> - in === read the Datatypes also

> - in == all convert to coersion
> - in === check avoid coersion

## string implementation to use '', "", ``

# Conditional Statements

# prompt() in javascript

## how to create a good variable name

### Rules

- $ and \_ will be allowed to the variable name
- can't start with number using variable name
- doesn't us empty space in variable name
- prebuild names are not allowed in create variable name
- cannot use reserved words like class,return,let.

# different case in javascript

1. camelCase
2. PascalCase
3. snake_Case
4. Kebab-Case
5. screaning snae_case

> Convention means if all are doing so you are doing

### good nameing conventions

- be descriptive
- use verbs for functions
- use booleans as question is /has/ should

## Template literal

> ${} -> interpoliation(substution)

> only ` ` used for interpoliation

> template literal used multiline

> \n - means new line character

- readability
- it has multiline support
- allows expressions
